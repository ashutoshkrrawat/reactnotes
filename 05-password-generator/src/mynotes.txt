/*
📌 useCallback and length issue (Important)

- When we write useCallback(() => {...}, []), that is we remove the dependencies it remembers the values 
  from the first time only (like length, numberAllowed, etc.).

- So if we change the length later (like using a slider), the function 
  still uses the old length.

- Even if useEffect runs again, it will call the old version of the function 
  unless we update the dependencies.

❌ Wrong:
useCallback(() => {
  // uses old length
}, []);

✅ Correct:
useCallback(() => {
  // uses updated length and options
}, [length, numberAllowed, characterAllowed]);

👉 Always include variables you use inside the function in the dependency list.
